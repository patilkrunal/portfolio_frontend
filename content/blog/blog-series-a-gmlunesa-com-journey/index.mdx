## A warm welcome

Good day from the Philippines to wherever you are from. I am starting this blog series to document my progress in the personal portfolio website that I am building.
I have been dabbling and releasing multiple versions of my website since I was in university (oh, to be young again!). You can check them out in the branches
of [this repository](https://github.com/gmlunesa/archive-gmlunesa-website). However, this is the first major overhaul involving most of the website components.

## A tech upgrade

For this website, I have consolidated my website and blog in one project. I also used an open source web framework, GatsbyJS to take care of things such as
optimization and build time for me. It has been a breeze to work with GatsbyJS despite the learning curve, hence I want to share my journey in a multi-part blog series!

## A visual revamp

Designing and developing from the ground up, consolidating the visual element proved to be important. Accessibility and aesthetics were both significantly improved
through adhering to a uniform stylesheet. As a backend developer who rarely deals with UI, it has been a struggle to reach a point where I am both satisfied and
proud of _how_ my website looks.

## A wrap-up

I am looking forward to write more articles and share more information with everyone! If you are interested, you can sign up for my newsletter through the form below.
